### Timber!
Makes it so trees fall down when cut.<br>
![Demonstration](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xmgjZzfd/images/0008b7b5228ba211322b06375c6e82ea68ea075f.gif)

A "tree" is defined internally as:
- `2..512 `&nbsp;logs of any kind
- `1..1024` non-permanent leaves of any kind

Logs connect diagonally and are initially checked upwards from the first log that is broken.<br>
Trees will not fall down if:
- the player is sneaking
- the item used to cut down the tree has silk touch
